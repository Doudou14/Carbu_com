# Carbu.com Home Assistant integration
[Carbu.com](https://www.Carbu.com/) Home Assistant custom component. This custom component has been built from the ground up to bring Carbu.com & Mazout.com site data to compare and save on your fuel oil, diesel and Super prices and integrate this information into Home Assistant to help you towards a better follow up. This integration is built against the public website provided by Carbu.com for Belgium and has not been tested for any other countries.

This integration is in no way affiliated with Carbu.com.

Some discussion on this topic can be found within [the Home Assistant community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/rest-sensor-needs-to-get-latest-element-of-list/404882/4).

For electricity price expectations [this Entso-E HACS integration](https://github.com/JaccoR/hass-entso-e) can be used.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myTselection/carbu_com/master/icon.png"/></p>


## Installation
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/): add url https://github.com/myTselection/carbu_com as custom repository (HACS > Integration > option: Custom Repositories)
- Restart Home Assistant
- Add 'Carbu.com' integration via HA Settings > 'Devices and Services' > 'Integrations'
- Provide country (currently only tested with BE), postal code and select the desired sensors
   - If your postal code is not unique, the name of the town can be selected from the dropdown in the next step of the setup config flow. See [carbu.com](https://carbu.com) website for known towns and postal codes.
   - A filter on supplier brand name can be set (optional). If the filter match, the fuel station will be considered, else next will be searched. A python regex filter value be set

A **service `carbu_com.get_lowest_fuel_price_on_route`** (**BETA**) to get the lowest fuel price on the route in between two postal codes. The lowest fuel price will be fetched and an event will be triggered with all the details found. The route is retrieved using an OpenRouteService API key (free key available at https://openrouteservice.org/). If too long routes are searched, it can easily get stuck because of the limitations of the quota of the free API.

## Status
Still some optimisations are planned, see [Issues](https://github.com/myTselection/carbu_com/issues) section in GitHub.

## Technical pointers
The main logic and API connection related code can be found within source code Carbu.com/custom_components/Carbu.com:
- [sensor.py](https://github.com/myTselection/carbu_com/blob/master/custom_components/carbu_com/sensor.py)
- [utils.py](https://github.com/myTselection/carbu_com/blob/master/custom_components/carbu_com/utils.py) -> mainly ComponentSession class

All other files just contain boilerplat code for the integration to work wtihin HA or to have some constants/strings/translations.

If you would encounter some issues with this custom component, you can enable extra debug logging by adding below into your `configuration.yaml`:
```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
     custom_components.carbu_com: debug
```
